## Pre-commit
We recommend running pre-commit prior to submitting pull requests. A [pre-commit config](.pre-commit-config.yaml) file is included in this repository and the following steps will get you up and running with pre-commit quickly:

1. Install pre-commit:

        pip install pre-commit

2. Deploy the pre-commit config:

        pre-commit install

Pre-commit is now set up to run each time you create a new commit. If you wish to run pre-commit against all tracked files in the repository without performing a commit, you can run:

```
pre-commit run --all
```

## Running tests for source plugins

Running the tests requires `ansible-rulebook` to be installed. Please review the [ansible-rulebook requirements](https://ansible-rulebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#requirements), but do not install `ansible-rulebook` manually. It will be installed via the test requirements.

We recommend setting up a Python virtual environment to install the test dependencies into:

1. Initiate the virtual environment:

        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate

2. Export the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable required by `ansible-rulebook`:

        export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-17-openjdk

3. Install the test requirements:

        pip install -r test_requirements.txt


### Integration tests

Integration tests require the addition of [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or [podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
We recommend installing the Python implementation of `docker-compose` via pip:
```
pip install docker-compose
```

Then install the collection directly from your local repo and execute the tests:
```
ansible-galaxy collection install .
pytest tests/integration
```

### Sanity tests

```sh
ansible-test sanity
```

### Units tests

```sh
ansible-test units
```
