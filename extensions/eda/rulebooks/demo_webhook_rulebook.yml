# This rulebook is for demo purposes only
# This webhook listens on port 5555 by default,
# you can override it by passing in an variable
# called port. If you have other webhook sources
# running on the default port 5555 you might see
# port conflicts.
# It logs every event received so it should work
# with any vendors payload.
# It doesn't use authentication to keep things simple
#
