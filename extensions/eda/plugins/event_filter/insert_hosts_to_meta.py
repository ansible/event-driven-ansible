"""insert_hosts_to_meta.py.

An ansible-rulebook event filter that extract hosts from the event data and
insert them to the meta dict. Ansible-rulebook will limit an ansible action
running on hosts in the meta dict.

Arguments:
---------
    host_path:      The json path inside the event data to find hosts.
                    Do nothing if the key is not present or does exist in event
    path_separator: The separator to interpret host_path. Default to "."
    host_separator: The separator to interpet host string.
                    host_path can point to a string or a list. If it is a single
                    string but contains multiple hosts, use this parameter to
                    delimits the hosts. Treat the vale as a single host if the
                    parameter is not present.

Example:
-------
    - ansible.eda.insert_hosts_to_meta
      host_path: app.target
      path_separator: .
      host_separator: ;
