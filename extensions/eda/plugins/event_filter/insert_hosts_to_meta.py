short_description: Extract hosts from the event data and insert them to the meta dict.
description:
  - An ansible-rulebook event filter that extracts hosts from the event data and
    inserts them to the meta dict. In ansible-rulebook, this will limit an action
    running on hosts in the meta dict.
options:
  host_path:
    description:
      - The json path inside the event data to find hosts.
      - Do nothing if the key is not present or does exist in event.
    type: str
    default: null
  path_separator:
    description:
      - The separator to interpret host_path.
    type: str
    default: "."
  host_separator:
    description:
      - The separator to interpret host string.
      - host_path can point to a string or a list. If it is a single
        string but contains multiple hosts, use this parameter to
        delimits the hosts. Treat the value as a single host if the
        parameter is not present.
    type: str
    default: null
  raise_error:
    description:
      - Whether raise PathNotExistError if host_path does not
        exist in the event.
      - It is recommended to turn it on during the rulebook
        development time. You can then turn it off for production.
    type: bool
    default: false
  log_error:
    description:
      - Whether log an error message if host_path does not
        exist in the event.
      - You can turn if off if it is expected to have events not
        having the host_path to avoid noises in the log.
    type: bool
    default: true
