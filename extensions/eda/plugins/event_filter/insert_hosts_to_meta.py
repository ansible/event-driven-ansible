"""insert_hosts_to_meta.py.

An ansible-rulebook event filter that extract hosts from the event data and
insert them to the meta dict. Ansible-rulebook will limit an ansible action
running on hosts in the meta dict.

Arguments:
---------
    host_path:      The json path inside the event data to find hosts.
                    Do nothing if the key is not present or does exist in event
    path_separator: The separator to interpret host_path. Default to "."
    host_separator: The separator to interpet host string.
                    host_path can point to a string or a list. If it is a single
                    string but contains multiple hosts, use this parameter to
                    delimits the hosts. Treat the vale as a single host if the
                    parameter is not present.
    raise_error:    Whether raise PathNotExistError if host_path does not
                    exist in the event. Default to false.
                    It is recommended to turn it on during the rulebook
                    development time. You can then turn it off for production.
    log_error:      Whether log an error message if host_path does not
                    exist in the event. Default to true.
                    You can turn if off if it is expected to have events not
                    having the host_path to avoid noises in the log.

Example:
-------
    filters:
      - ansible.eda.insert_hosts_to_meta:
          host_path: "app.target"
          path_separator: "."
          host_separator: ";"
          raise_error: true
          log_error: true
