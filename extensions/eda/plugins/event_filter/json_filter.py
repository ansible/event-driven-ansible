"""json_filter.py:   An event filter that filters keys out of events.

Includes override excludes.

This is useful to exclude information from events that is unneeded by the rule
engine.

Arguments:
---------
    * exclude_keys = a list of strings or patterns to remove
    * include_keys = a list of strings or patterns to keep even if it matches
    exclude_keys patterns.
