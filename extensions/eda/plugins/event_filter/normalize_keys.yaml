  short_description: Change keys that contain non-alpha numeric or underscore to underscores.
  description: |
    - An event filter that changes keys that contain non alpha numeric or
      underscore to underscores.
    - For instance, the key server-name becomes the new key server_name.
      If there are consecutive non alpha numeric or under score, they would
      be coalesced into a single underscore.
      For instance the key server.com/&abc becomes server_com_abc
      instead of server_com__abc.
    - If there is a existing key with the normalized name, it will get overwritten
      by default. If you don't want to over write it you can pass in "overwrite: false"
      The default value of overwrite is true.
  version_added: '2.3.2'
