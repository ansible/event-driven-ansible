## Description

The primary purpose of this collection is to reduce manual tasks and deliver more efficient mission-critical workflows. By leveraging this collection, organizations can automate a variety of error-prone and time-consuming tasks and respond to changing conditions in any IT domain across IT environments for better agility and resiliency.

## Requirements

### Ansible version compatibility

Tested with the Ansible Core >= 2.15.0 versions, and the current development version of Ansible. Ansible Core versions before 2.15.0 are not supported.

### Python version compatibility

This collection requires Python 3.9 or greater.

### Additional dependencies

This collection requires ansible-rulebook 1.0.0 or greater.

## Installation

The `ansible.eda` collection can be installed with the Ansible Galaxy command-line tool:

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.eda
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: ansible.eda
```

Note that if you install any collections from Ansible Galaxy, they will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade the Ansible package.
To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.eda --upgrade
```

A specific version of the collection can be installed by using the `version` keyword in the `requirements.yml` file:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: ansible.eda
    version: 1.0.0
```

or using the ansible-galaxy command as follows

```shell
ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.eda:==1.0.0
```

The Python module dependencies are not installed by ansible-galaxy. They must be installed manually using pip:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Refer to the following for more details.

## Use Cases

You can either call modules, rulebooks and playbooks by their Fully Qualified Collection Name (FQCN), such as ansible.eda.activation, or you can call modules by their short name if you list the ansible.eda collection in the playbook's collections keyword:

```yaml
---
  - name: Create a rulebook activation
    ansible.eda.activation:
      name: "Example Activation"
      description: "Example Activation description"
      project: "Example Project"
      rulebook_name: "basic_short.yml"
      decision_environment_name: "Example Decision Environment"
      enabled: False
      awx_token_id: 1

  - name: Get information about the rulebook activation
    ansible.eda.activation_info:
      name: "Example Activation"

  - name: Delete rulebook activation
    ansible.eda.activation:
      name: "Example Activation"
      state: absent
```
